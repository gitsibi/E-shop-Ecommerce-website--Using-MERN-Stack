# Ecommerce Follow Along Project
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

#### 1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
 **MongoDB :** A database for storing application data in a flexible, document based format.
 **Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
 **React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
 **Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.
 
#### 2. REST API Structure  
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.  
We’ll create APIs for:  
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.  
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.  
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design  
We’ll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.  


#### 4. Authentication  
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:  
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.  
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users’ identities.


## Milestone 3 :
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.

## Milestone 4 :
created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a User Controller to manage user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.
